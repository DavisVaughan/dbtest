Title: Test automation for dbplyr/odbc database support
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Edgar Ruiz
Maintainer: Edgar Ruiz <edgar@rstudio.com>
Description: It uses testthat to run a battery of tests
    against a given database connection.  The idea is to
    find out what translations from dplyr are and what are not
    supported by a given database.  It also useful to test
    new translations that close the gap of what it is supported
    by dplyr.
